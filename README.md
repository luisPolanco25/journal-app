# Journal App

This is an app made with `Redux`, `React.js` and `Firebase`. It also uses some packages such as `validator.js` and `Sweetalert2`. This is a project from a course of <a href="https://fernando-herrera.com/#/home">Fernando Herrera</a>, but I tried to make it on my own way and I even made it much more responsive.
