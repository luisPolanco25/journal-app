# Journal App

This is an app made with `Redux`, `React.js` and `Firebase`. It also uses some packages such as `validator.js` and `Sweetalert2`. This is a project from a course of <a href="https://fernando-herrera.com/#/home">Fernando Herrera</a>, but I tried to make it on my own way and I even made it much more responsive.

### Note

I already have a user created and a user to be registered because this is just a project to learn redux, so you just have to log in with the user that is already provided and you also don't need to register in this app.
